This study aims to comprehensively assess the bankruptcy risk of companies by employing three different versions of Altman's Z-Score model: Z, Z1, and Z2. 
Problem Statement
I am working on providing a response to this problem statement.
Q1- How effective is Altman's Z-Score in predicting bankruptcy, and what are the comparative strengths of its different versions?
Q2- How do liquidity, profitability, efficiency, market value, and net worth differ between bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies in our study using the modified Altman model? and how does t-test analysis enhance our understanding of these differences?
Q3- Can K-means clustering effectively classify companies in Finance, Pharmacy, and Technology as distressed, in a gray zone, or safe between 2000 and 2018?
